## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow  




### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to use the **`box-shadow`** property to create a clean and modern card design.  
I also discovered how the **`gap`** property simplifies spacing between elements inside a flex container, making the layout cleaner and easier to manage.

Hereâ€™s an example:

```css
.main {
  box-shadow: 7px 7px 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); /* Creates a bold shadow effect */
}

.avt {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: left;
  align-items: center;
  margin-top: 12px;
  gap: 10px; 
}
